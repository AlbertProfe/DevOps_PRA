# Step-by-Step Guide: Create an ECS Service

> This guide explains how to create an ECS service in **Amazon Elastic Container Service > Clusters > booksback > Create Service**.

It includes detailed steps for configuring the:

- environment,

- deployment,

- <mark>networking</mark>,

- and load balancing.

---

Create:

## **1. Environment**

### **Cluster**

- **Existing Cluster**: Select the cluster `booksback` where your service will run.

### Launch Type

- **Launch Type**: Select `FARGATE`. 

**Explanation**: Fargate is a serverless compute engine that allows you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure. 

### **Compute Configuration**

- **Launch Type**: Choose `FARGATE` (for serverless container management).
- **Task Definition**: Select your pre-created task definition (e.g., `booksback-task`).
- **Service Name**: Enter a name for the service (e.g., `booksback-service`).
- **Number of Tasks**: Specify the desired number of tasks to launch and maintain (e.g., `1`).

**Explanation**: This step ensures that your service runs on the selected cluster with the specified task definition and maintains the desired number of tasks.

---

## **2. Deployment Configuration**

### **Service Type**

- **App Type**: Select `Application`.
  
  - **Explanation**: This is suitable for long-running applications or services that need to be highly available.

- **Service Type**: Select `Replica`.
  
  - **Explanation**: Replica ensures that the desired number of tasks are running at all times. This is ideal for most application workloads.

### **Rolling Update Deployment**

- Deployment Type: `Rolling Update` (default).
  - **Explanation**: Rolling updates replace tasks gradually to avoid downtime during updates.

### **Minimum Healthy Percent**

- Default: `100%` (or adjust based on your availability requirements).
  - **Explanation**: Ensures that at least this percentage of tasks remain healthy during deployments.

### **Maximum Percent**

- Default: `200%` (or adjust as needed).
  - **Explanation**: Allows this percentage of tasks to run during deployments, including both old and new tasks.

This configuration ensures that your ECS service is set up with a serverless launch type, <mark>uses a replica service type for high availability, </mark>and deploys updates with minimal disruption.

**Explanation**: Deployment configuration determines how tasks are replaced during updates to ensure availability.

## **3. Networking**

### **VPC**

- Select the VPC where your ECS service will run.

### **Subnets**

- Choose at least *two subnets in different Availability Zones for high availability.*

### **Security Group**

- Select or create a `security group` with the following<mark> inbound rules</mark>:
  - **Custom TCP Rule**: Port 80, Source: Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) – Allows HTTP traffic to reach the load balancer.
  - **Custom TCP Rule**: Port 8080, Source: Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) – Allows traffic from the load balancer to reach containers.
  - **HTTP Rule**: Port 80, Source: Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) – Enables web traffic.

### **Auto-assign Public IP**

- Set to `Enabled` if your service needs internet access.

**Explanation**: Networking ensures that your service is accessible via the internet and securely routes traffic to containers using security groups.

---

## **4. Load Balancing**

### **Load Balancer Type**

- Select `Application Load Balancer (ALB)` for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

**Container**

- Host Port: Container Port: `8080:8080` (HTTP).

### **Listener Configuration**

- Listener Port: `80` (HTTP).

### **Target Group**

1. Create a new target group:
   
   - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `booksback-target-group`).
   - Protocol: `HTTP`.
   - Port: `80` (the port your container listens on).
   - (*Optional*) Target Type: `IP` (for Fargate tasks).

2. Configure health checks:
   
   - Path: `/api/books` or a specific<mark> endpoint for health checks</mark>.
   - (*Optional*) Healthy Threshold: Default value or adjust as needed.
   - (*Optional*) Interval and Timeout: Use default values unless specific requirements exist.

3. Register Targets:
   
   - Ensure ECS tasks are automatically registered as targets in this group.

**Explanation**: The ALB distributes incoming traffic from port 80 to the target group, which forwards it to container tasks running on port 8080.

## **5. Review and Create**

1. Review all configurations, including environment, deployment, networking, and load balancing.
2. Click "<mark>Create Service</mark>" to deploy your ECS service.

---

## Monitoring

After creating the service:

1. Go to the "Tasks" tab in your cluster to <mark>verify that tasks are running.</mark>
2. Check the ALB's target group health status to ensure targets are healthy.
3. Test accessing your application via the <mark>ALB's DNS name or public IP.</mark>

> This setup ensures that **traffic flows from the internet through the Application Load Balancer on port 80** and is forwarded securely to containers listening on port 8080.
